dataVis provides webbased interactive plots for your data. It is meant to abstract away any command line expertise required to process large files as well as plotting options. This app can be downloaded and run on you machine as well as used here. The application provides basic plot types at the moment but is under active development. The aim is to re-use the component in a bigger application.

use this app [here](https://ataulhaleem.github.io/dataVis/) or run on local machine as follows




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
